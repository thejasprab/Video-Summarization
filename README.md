# Video-Summarization
Video summarization using K- means clustering
Here this project helps to summarize the input video by converting the video into one second frames and these frames are converted into histograms and the distribution of colours is plotted. Using the values of colours mainly RGB the average value is taken and unique datapoints is obtained. SO far have made a unique mapping for a frame to a data point. Uding these datapoint clustering algorithm is applied and the centroids of the clusters are the resultant frames that summarizes the video input.
